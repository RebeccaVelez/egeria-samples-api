# Assessing and improving IT systems

IT systems (computers) use a lot of electricity.

Coco Pharmaceuticals use many IT systems to run their business, automate their factories, depots, and labs.
The research work in particular requires powerful machines running calculations and other analytics to identify,
develop and validate their treatments.

The number of IT systems continues to grow since new systems are often added and old systems are never removed.
One surefire way to reduce the impact of their operations is to remove obsolete IT systems and streamline/consolidate their
processing onto a smaller number of more power efficient computers.
