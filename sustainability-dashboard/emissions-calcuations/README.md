# Calculating Carbon Emissions

An organization produces carbon emissions through the activities 
it engages in. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) describes how to calculate these emissions for a variety of activities and sources.
Three classes of emissions are defined:

* Scope 1 - Direct Emissions from Operations
* Scope 2 - Indirect Emissions from Utility Consumption
* Scope 3 - Other indirect emissions

Each of these scopes encompasses a range of activities and methods 
to calculate carbon emissions. Documentation and calculation tools are available at https://ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools.
The following activities have methods and calculations associated with them:

## Scope 1 - Direct Emissions

* Stationary Combustion - for ovens, mixers and other equipment
* Fugitive Gas Emissions - HydroFluoroCarbons (HFCs) leaks from refrigeration units
* Mobile Compustion - from vehicles involved in operations
