# Building the sustainability dashboard

In order to keep sustainability in people's minds (and to provide data to the different regulators),
Coco Pharmaceuticals want to have a set of dashboards and reports that shows their current status and how it is changing
(better or worse) over time.

Data pipelines take the data they have, transform and combine it into a sustainability database that supplies
data to these new dashboards and reports.

The samples for the sustainability dashboard includes building the data pipelines, cataloguing them
and recording lineage to show the origin of the data in the reports/dashboards.





to calculate emissions from stationary combustion we need to know how much of which kinds of fuel were used by the equipment. Upon investigation, the team discovered that the most complete source of  information was in Coco Pharmaceutical's Procurement database.
