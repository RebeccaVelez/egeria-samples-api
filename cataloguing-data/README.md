# Finding and cataloguing activity data

Understanding the impact of operations takes more than utility bills.  It is important to understand electricity use, 
impact of travel, loss of coolants (such as CFCs), fuel for vehicles, ...

Data about activities that produce emissions need to be catalogued so the teams analysing the data and making choices on actions
to take can find the data. 

The catalog entries for this data need to link to the appropriate parts of the operations inventory to provide
context to the data.  Locations may have their own databases for recording this information.
Often data from different sources uses different units, terminology and reference values. 
The process of cataloguing data must capture this type of detail to make it consumable by the analysis processes.

The samples for cataloguing data show how to catalog data and link/tag it, so it is ready for analysis.
