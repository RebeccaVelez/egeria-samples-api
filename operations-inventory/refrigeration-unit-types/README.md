# Refrigeration Unit Types

There are over 600 types defined in the [open metadata type system](https://egeria-project.org/types/) that cover
many of the types of information that you would want to store in Egeria.  Nevertheless, the type system 
is extensible, so you can add new types to store information about anything.

This sample shows how to create a new type to store information about refrigeration units.
New types are defined in an [open metadata archive](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/open-metadata-archive)
that can be loaded into any open metadata server.  Once they are loaded, you can create instances of these types.  

The sample also shows how to use the [Open Metadata Store Client](https://odpi.github.io/egeria/org/odpi/openmetadata/accessservices/governanceprogram/client/OpenMetadataStoreClient.html) 
to create, update and delete elements of this new type.

The documentation for creating new types is in the [developer guide](https://egeria-project.org/guides/developer/open-metadata-archives/defining-new-types/).
