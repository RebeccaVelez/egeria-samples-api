# Creating the operations inventory

Coco Pharmaceuticals need to report on all aspects of their operation.  
To ensure they have not missed anything, and to identify where improvements can be made,
they need lists of their locations and the equipment and activity at each location.  This is called the operations
inventory and provides a context for the data they collect.

For example, they have utility bills for each of the sites they operate.  
The operations inventory will tell them what type of activities - such as office work,
manufacturing, research, ...) are occurring at each site, what types of equipment runs there and
which part of the business is responsible for each aspect. With the inventory they can apportion the power or
water use to these aspects and then review the data from different perspectives:

* Business area (and hence associated revenue)
* Types of activity
* Types of facilities (such as offices, data centres, )
* Types of equipment (such as IT systems, refrigeration units, robots, vehicles, ...)

This way they can pick the most important things to change first.

The samples for building the operations inventory show how to define new types of equipment, catalog the
locations, facilities, equipments and activities at each location and issue queries to show different
parts of the inventory.
