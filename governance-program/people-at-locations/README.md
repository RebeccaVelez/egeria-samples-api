# Counting people at locations


Emissions produced in an office environment are primarily driven by the number of people at work, which also often correlates with the size of the office space. More people means more heating and cooling, often over a larger area. This information is combined with power consumption information to help us calculate and analyze Scope 2 emissions. 

This sample can be run multiple times, so it begins by deleting the elements it plans to create if they are already defined in the metadata server.
