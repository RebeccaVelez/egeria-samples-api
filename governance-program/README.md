# Extending the governance program

Coco Pharmaceuticals has an existing governance program that helps them manage their operations.
This governance program is divided into multiple governance domains that each focus on a specific aspect of their
operations.  For example, they have a domain for data governance, a domain for security and a domain for privacy.

The samples for extending the governance program show how to add a new governance domain for sustainability.

* [Creating the definition describing the new sustainability domain](sustainability-governance-domain) to collect all the aspects of the sustainability initiative together.
* [Appointing Tom Tally the sustainability leader](sustainability-leader) to act as a focal point.
* [Setting up the sustainability community](sustainability-community) to coordinate sustainability efforts across the organization.
* [Listing the emails of all people working on the sustainability initiative](sustainability-team-emails) to send them regular updates on the sustainability program.
* [Creating a sustainability subject area](sustainability-subject-area) to organize glossary terms, valid value sets and metrics.
* [Creating a glossary of sustainability terminology](sustainability-glossary) to teach people about the new concepts and ensure they are used correctly.
* [Setting up the sustainability governance definitions](sustainability-governance-definitions) to define how they are going to tackle the challenge.
* [Setting up the sustainability project](sustainability-project) to organize the work to get the sustainability initiative up and running.
* [Creating a new metadata server for sustainability](sustainability-metadata-server) to allow Tom to experiment with some new ideas.
* [Creating a sustainability governance zone](sustainability-governance-zone) to organize data for sustainability.
* [Manage assets in the sustainability zone](sustainability-zone-assets) to ensure they are both protected and easy to find.
* [Defining sustainability metrics](sustainability-metrics) to set up the measures and targets for the governance program.
* [Counting the number of people working at each location](people-at-locations) to understand the expected space and resources they should need.
* [Creating a CFC-Free Certification Type](cfc-free-certification-type) to identify sites and facilities that are CFC-Free.
