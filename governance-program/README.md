# Extending the governance program

Coco Pharmaceuticals has an existing governance program that helps them manage their operations.
This governance program is divided into multiple governance domains that each focus on a specific aspect of their
operations.  For example, they have a domain for data governance, a domain for security and a domain for privacy.

The samples for extending the governance program show how to add a new governance domain for sustainability.
