# Sustainability metadata server

Tom Tally is new to working with metadata, and she is keen to experiment.
She asks Gary Geeke to set up a test metadata server with some sample metadata
in it.

This sample shows how to define a new metadata server for testing.
It loads an open metadata archive with metadata from Coco Pharmaceuticals.
